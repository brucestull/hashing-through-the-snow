# Simple Hashing Algorithm

- [Simple Salting Algorithm: Python - ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/37044e78-cd8e-40b8-bced-454fba1c6f3c)

Creating a simple salting algorithm that uses UTC time as part of the salt can enhance the uniqueness and security of your hashes. This approach is useful for password storage or other scenarios where you want to ensure that even identical inputs result in different hashed values over time.

Below is a basic example of how you can implement such an algorithm in Python. This example uses the `hashlib` library for hashing and `datetime` to include the current UTC time as part of the salt. Note that this is a simple demonstration and might need adjustments based on your specific security requirements.

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
import hashlib
import datetime
```

### Step 2: Generate Salt Using UTC Time

The salt will be a combination of the current UTC time and a unique identifier (if available) to ensure that the salt changes over time and is unique for each use case.

```python
def generate_salt():
    utc_time = datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    # You can add any other unique identifier to the salt, if necessary
    return utc_time
```

### Step 3: Hash the Input with the Salt

This function takes an input (e.g., a password) and the salt, then returns the hashed value using SHA-256 (or any other preferred hashing algorithm).

```python
def hash_with_salt(input_value, salt):
    # Combine the input value and the salt
    combined = f"{input_value}{salt}".encode()
    
    # Create a SHA-256 hash of the combined input and salt
    hash_object = hashlib.sha256(combined)
    
    # Return the hexadecimal representation of the digest
    return hash_object.hexdigest()
```

### Step 4: Example Usage

This demonstrates how to use the above functions to hash an input with a salt that includes the current UTC time.

```python
def main():
    # Example input to hash
    input_value = "example_password"
    
    # Generate a salt that includes the current UTC time
    salt = generate_salt()
    
    # Hash the input with the generated salt
    hashed_value = hash_with_salt(input_value, salt)
    
    print(f"Salt: {salt}")
    print(f"Hashed Value: {hashed_value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run this script, it will output the generated salt (based on the current UTC time) and the corresponding hashed value of the input. Each execution will result in a different salt and hence a different hash, even for the same input value, due to the changing UTC time component in the salt. 

Remember, storing both the hash and the salt is necessary for future verification of inputs against the stored hash. Also, consider security best practices and compliance with relevant regulations or standards when implementing hashing and salting mechanisms.
